title: Climate-adaptive rice farming in flood-prone croplands contributes to economic benefits and environmental sustainability
---

Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of flooding worldwide, posing a growing threat to agricultural production. Switching from traditional flood-sensitive crops to rice cultivation in floodplain areas presents a promising adaptation strategy, as rice is more tolerant to submergence; however, its feasibility and cost-effectiveness remain unexplored. Here, we develop a spatially explicit framework that integrates satellite remote sensing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and spatial modeling to evaluate the potential for rice farming in flood-prone croplands across the United States and to quantify the associated economic benefits and environmental trade-offs. Our analysis identifies ~84,000 km² of cropland flooded between 2001 and 2021, accounting for 39% of the total flooded extent. Flooding leads to significant yield losses of 11–29% for major crops such as soybeans, corn, and wheat, with over 75% of these flooded croplands highly or moderately suitable for rice cultivation. Introducing rice in these areas under alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation could generate net economic returns of $6.67 billion and reduce environmental costs by $2.30 billion compared to conventional continuous flooding (CF). The greatest benefits are observed in severely flood-affected regions of Minnesota, North Dakota, Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa. These findings highlight the potential of targeted rice adoption as a climate-resilient strategy to enhance agricultural sustainability and optimize economic-environmental outcomes under increasing climate risks.

Cost-benefit of agricultural rice farming in historically flooded areas under alternate wetting and drying (AWD) versus continuous flooding (CF) irrigation methods. Maps show spatial distribution of total cost or benefit under AWD (a) and CF (b) aggregated at a 0.1° × 0.1° grid resolution. (c) Top 8 states with the highest total benefit. (d) Top 8 states with the highest total cost. (e) Cumulative cost-benefit curves by flood intensity percentile (high to low). The x-axis ranks 0.1° × 0.1° grid cells from most to least severe flood intensity, while the y-axis shows cumulative net economic returns.
