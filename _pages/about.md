I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the [Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University](https://www.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn/), with an anticipated graduation date in April 2024. As of May 2024, I will join as a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Department of Global Development, Cornell University](https://cals.cornell.edu/global-development). I earned my B.S. degree in Geographical Information Science from Sun Yat-sen University in 2019. My research interests focus on combining remote sensing and AI for sustainability development.
