I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Department of Global Development, Cornell University](https://cals.cornell.edu/global-development){:target="_blank"}. I obtained my Ph.D. in Ecology from the [Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University](https://www.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} in 2024 and my B.S. in Geographical Information Science from Sun Yat-sen University in 2019. My research interests focus on harnessing satellite remote sensing and computational approaches to monitor global environmental changes in support of sustainable development.
