title: Inequality in infrastructure access and its association with health disparities
---

Economic, social and environmental infrastructure forms a fundamental pillar of societal development. Ensuring equitable access to infrastructure for all residents is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, yet knowledge gaps remain in infrastructure accessibility and inequality and their associations with human health. Here we generate gridded maps of economic, social and environmental infrastructure distribution and apply population-weighted exposure models and mixed-effects regressions to investigate differences in population access to infrastructure and their health implications across 166 countries. The results reveal contrasting inequalities in infrastructure access across regions and infrastructure types. Global South countries experience only 50–80% of the infrastructure access of Global North countries, whereas their associated inequality levels are 9–44% higher. Both infrastructure access and inequality are linked to health outcomes, with this relationship being especially pronounced in economic infrastructure. These findings underscore the necessity of informed decision-making to rectify infrastructure disparities for promoting human well-being.


This study provides a comprehensive, multi-dimensional analysis of global inequality in infrastructure access and the associated disparity in health outcomes. Given the broad interpretation of infrastructure, here we define ‘infrastructure’ as the physical systems and facilities essential for the functioning of the economy and society, ‘infrastructure access’ as individuals’ capacity to reach and use nearby infrastructure, and ‘infrastructure access inequality’ as geographical disparities in the availability of these systems and facilities. We categorize infrastructure into three types based on its primary function: economic, social and environmental. Economic infrastructure encompasses facilities that support business activities, such as telecommunication, energy supply systems, and transport and distribution networks. Social infrastructure comprises facilities providing social services, such as schools and hospitals. Environmental infrastructure, linked to living conditions and ecosystem services, includes resources such as water and waste facilities, green spaces, clean air, and thermal comfort. This multi-dimensional conceptualization of infrastructure leads to an enhanced understanding of the diverse ways in which individuals meet their needs and communities manage public goods across regions.
